### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Drag-NDrop.

I'm currently studying for a programming degree.

I specialize in Powershell scripting, but are working on expanding my horizon.
Currently, the following programming/scripting languages has my interest:
* C#
* Bash
* AngularJS

I'm involved with the OCIScripts community, which i really like to be a part of.
Check out the OCISCripts repo to get an idea of it(Hint - you might learn there's free VM's in it for you).

Through my interest in OCIScripts, i've also become involved in Berkeley University's Boinc project, where I'm currently try to forge ahead on a persistent issue they have with their client software.

In both projects i've found great people. Bright minds, to spar with. And i love it.

My answers to "Who are you?"
* I like to help people.
* And i like to create tools that empower them.
* I want the code i write to be useful to somebody. I am done writing code, just for me.

Ask me anything about Powershell. If i don't know the answer, odds that i do want to know it, are 99.8%.

Pronouns.. yeah.. i don't do pronouns. And I'm genuinely sorry, if i offend you by not doing that. 
I guess i expected you to accept me to, for who i am.

How to reach me..
I like my privacy.. Hmm.. Tough one. Reach out through the OCIScripts community. Feel free to DM me.
This is the link to the Discord: https://discord.gg/SGhcB7zHEm

Fun fact: I'm not an actual viking.
